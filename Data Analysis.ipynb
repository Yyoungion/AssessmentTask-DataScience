    "### Non-Functional Requirements \n",
    "\n",
    "**Usability** \\\n",
    "The User Interface(UI) is required to have easy navigation, good performance and being flexible with erros. The UI needs to be simple and easy to work with. It needs to be able to handle large amouts of data without glitching or crashing. The UI also needs to be able to handle errors, misinputs and other complications that might occur. \\\n",
    "The README should give an outline or description of the project/program being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reliability** \n",
    "The system should output an error when encountering anything unexpected during the data analysis process. To ensure data integrity, backups should be made regularly. Duplicated data, or incorrect data should be removed before analysis."
